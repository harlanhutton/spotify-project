# **Fun Facts**

Outside of graduate school, I am a musician. My band Harlan has toured all over the country (we were even awarded grants to do so). I am also an avid runner, and I've run the St. Jude half marathon 6 times so far. I love to cook for family and friends and my favorite TV show right now is Schitt's Creek. One of my favorite jobs I've ever had was working at MemPops, a popsicle food truck in Memphis! I worked all through college until Coronavirus and still miss it.
